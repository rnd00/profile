# [rnd00.github.io/profile](https://rnd00.github.io/profile)

my own profile page, 'nuff said.

## little update per 2022/01

i'm removing my twitter link because it's suspended since long time ago-- and people have been asking about it when they see my profile page.

[@nantokawakaran](https://twitter.com/nantokawakaran) [^1] was made when i was working in a startup company around 2019, using my old company email account. it was made just to put some likes on company's post and checking on some news.

as i wrote when i made the site, it was already suspended, and i just don't really check it as i'm not using twitter at all.

contact me through my github if you need me.

## something-something

i'll be letting this one be as is and not changing it anymore.

## why

as an assignment + something to motivates myself and something to keep working on

## how

per 02/05/20, it was written with html and some bootstrap magic

---

# notes

everything is just html + css here, don't get too far with your imaginations and keep it on the borderline of what githubpages can do for you (as because it's free thing, can't push it that much)

# to-do

## what you can actually do

- *making it actually looks real*
- not to be too playful and keep things real *by redoing everything*
- getting a carousel (?) for each of your projects and the project where you contributed
- link to lewagon (tokyo?)
- get rid of the `blockquotes` thing and `past-time` too as it's not really good

## what has been done

- sticking the footer down (use flexbox)

## somewhere around the horizon

- adding more items to the pages
- adding [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) for blog?
- looking for more styling ideas and whatnots
- custom domain?
- ~~downsizing and minimalizing the bg image to make it loads faster~~
- ~~actually using rails later?~~

---

anyway don't forget to keep having fun while making it looks nice (and real)
