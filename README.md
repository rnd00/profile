# [rnd00.github.io/profile](https://rnd00.github.io/profile)

my own profile page, 'nuff said.

## why

as an assignment + something to motivates myself and something to keep working on

## how

per 02/05/20, it was written with html and some bootstrap magic

---

# notes

everything is just html + css here, don't get too far with your imaginations and keep it on the borderline of what githubpages can do for you (as because it's free thing, can't push it that much)

# to-do

## what you can actually do

- *making it actually looks real*
- not to be too playful and keep things real *by redoing everything*

## somewhere around the horizon

- adding more items to the pages
- adding [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) for blog?
- looking for more styling ideas and whatnots
- custom domain?
- ~~downsizing and minimalizing the bg image to make it loads faster~~
- ~~actually using rails later?~~

---

anyway don't forget to keep having fun while making it looks nice (and real)
