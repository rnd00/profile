# [rnd00.github.io/profile](https://rnd00.github.io/profile)

my own profile page, 'nuff said.

## why

as an assignment + something to motivates myself and something to keep working on

## how

per 02/05/20, it was written with html and some bootstrap magic

---

# to-do

- adding more items to the pages
- downsizing and minimalizing the bg image to make it loads faster
- adding [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) for blog?
- looking for more styling ideas and whatnots
- custom domain?
- actually using rails later?

---

anyway don't forget to keep having fun while making it looks nice (and real)
